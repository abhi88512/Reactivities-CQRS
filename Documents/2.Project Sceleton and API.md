# Section 2: API DDD Skeleton

## What is a Walking Skeleton?

### Definition
A small, functional implementation of a system that performs a basic end-to-end task. In this course, it means retrieving data from a database via an API and displaying it in a browser.

### Purpose
Sets up the basic framework of the application, allowing architecture and functionality to evolve later.

### Key Idea
It doesn’t need the final architecture but connects the main components.

> **Quote by Alistair Cockburn:** A walking skeleton is a tiny implementation that links the main architectural components, allowing the architecture and functionality to evolve in parallel.


## Clean Architecture Overview

### Domain-Centric Approach
The domain is the core of the application, containing business entities (e.g., an `Activity` entity for a social network app).

### Layers
- **Domain**: Contains business entities (e.g., `Activity` class). No dependencies on other layers.
- **Application**: Handles business logic, depends on the Domain layer.
- **API**: Receives and responds to HTTP requests, depends on the Application layer.
- **Persistence**: Connects to the database, depends on the Domain layer.

### Dependencies
`API` → `Application` → (`Domain`, `Persistence`).

The API has transitive access to `Domain` and `Persistence` via the `Application` layer.

## Project Setup with .NET CLI

### .NET CLI
Command-line tool for creating and managing .NET projects (part of the .NET SDK).

### Solution File
A container for multiple projects, created with:
```sh
dotnet new sln
```

### Projects Created
- **API Project**: A Web API project to handle HTTP requests.
  ```sh
  dotnet new webapi -n API --use-controllers
  ```
  > The `--use-controllers` flag ensures the project uses API controllers (not minimal APIs) for better structure.

- **Class Libraries**:
  - **Domain**: For business entities.
  - **Application**: For business logic.
  - **Persistence**: For database connections.
  ```sh
  dotnet new classlib -n Domain
  dotnet new classlib -n Application
  dotnet new classlib -n Persistence
  ```

### Add Projects to Solution
```sh
dotnet sln add API
dotnet sln add Application
dotnet sln add Domain
dotnet sln add Persistence
```

### Set Up Project References
- `API` references `Application`.
- `Application` references `Domain` and `Persistence`.
- `Persistence` references `Domain`.

> This can be done in VS Code via the Solution Explorer or by editing the `.csproj` files.

## Project Structure

### API Project
- Handles HTTP requests and responses.
- Contains a `Controllers` folder (due to `--use-controllers` flag).

### Application Project
- Processes business logic.
- Uses Domain entities and interacts with Persistence.

### Domain Project
- Contains business entities (e.g., `Activity` class for social activities).
- No dependencies on other projects.

### Persistence Project
- Manages database connections using Entity Framework.
- Translates C# code to SQL queries.

## Key Commands Recap

- Check .NET SDK version: `dotnet --info`
- List available templates: `dotnet new list`
- Create a solution: `dotnet new sln`
- Create a Web API project: `dotnet new webapi -n API --use-controllers`
- Create a class library: `dotnet new classlib -n <ProjectName>`
- Add projects to solution: `dotnet sln add <ProjectName>`

## Running the API Project

### Running the API
- **Steps**:
  - Open a terminal in VS Code (use the shortcut to toggle the terminal).
  - Navigate to the `API` directory:
    ```bash
    cd API
    ```
  - Run the project:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
  - The API starts on a random port (e.g., `http://localhost:5280`).

### Configuring the Port
- **File**: `Properties/launchSettings.json` controls how the API starts.
- **Default Setup**:
  - Contains profiles for `http` and `https`.
  - The first profile (e.g., `http://localhost:5280`) is used by default.
- **Customization**:
  - Edit `launchSettings.json` to use a fixed port (e.g., `https://localhost:5001`) for consistency.
  - Remove the `http` profile and use only `https` for security (required for authentication later).
  - Example modification:
    ```json
    {
      "profiles": {
        "https": {
          "commandName": "Project",
          "dotnetRunMessages": true,
          "launchBrowser": false,
          "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:5001",
          "environmentVariables": {
            "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
- **Why HTTPS?**: Matches production settings and supports authentication.
- **Self-Signed Certificate**: .NET uses a self-signed certificate for HTTPS in development. If browser security warnings appear, follow the troubleshooting guide provided in the course resources.

### Using `dotnet watch`
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  dotnet watch
  ```
- **Purpose**: Runs the API with a file watcher that detects code changes and reloads the application.
- **Hot Reload**: Automatically applies some code changes without restarting, but API projects may require manual restarts for certain changes.
- **Benefit**: Simplifies development by updating the running application when code changes.

### Key Files
- **Program.cs**:
  - Entry point for the API, equivalent to a `Main` method (hidden in modern .NET templates).
  - Configures services (e.g., controllers) and the HTTP request pipeline (middleware).
- **API.csproj**:
  - Defines the project’s target framework (e.g., .NET 9) and settings.
  - Includes `<Nullable>enable</Nullable>` for nullable reference types (explained later).
- **Controllers Folder**: Contains API controllers for handling endpoints.

##Creating the First Domain Entity


# Section: Setting Up the DbContext and Entity Framework

## Introduction to DbContext

### Definition
The `DbContext` class in Entity Framework Core is a critical component that represents a session with the database, enabling querying and saving of data for your application's entities.

### Purpose
The `DbContext` acts as a bridge between your .NET application and the database, managed by Entity Framework Core, which is an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that simplifies database interactions.

### Key Idea
The `DbContext` manages database connections and incorporates the Unit of Work and Repository patterns for efficient data access.

> **Analogy**: Think of the `DbContext` as a librarian who organizes and retrieves books (data) from a library (database) for you, keeping track of your requests and updates.


## Installing Required NuGet Packages

### Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite
- **Purpose**: Enables Entity Framework Core to work with SQLite databases.
- **Installation**:
  - Use the NuGet Gallery extension in VS Code or the Package Manager in Visual Studio/Rider.
  - In the terminal, navigate to the **persistence** project and run:
    ```bash
    dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite --version 9.0.0
    ```
  - **Important**: Ensure the package version matches your .NET runtime (e.g., 9.0 for .NET 9). Select `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite`, not `Sqlite.Core`, to avoid issues.

### Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
- **Purpose**: Provides tools for creating and managing Entity Framework migrations in the **API** (startup) project.
- **Installation**:
  - In the terminal, navigate to the **API** project and run:
    ```bash
    dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design --version 9.0.0
    ```
  - This package is essential for running migration commands.

## Creating the AppDbContext Class

### Steps
1. In the **persistence** project, create a new file named `AppDbContext.cs`.
2. Define the `AppDbContext` class, inheriting from `DbContext`:
   ```csharp
   using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

   namespace Persistence
   {
       public class AppDbContext : DbContext
       {
           public AppDbContext(DbContextOptions options) : base(options)
           {
           }

           public required DbSet<Activity> Activities { get; set; }
       }
   }
   ```
3. **Key Points**:
   - The `DbContextOptions` parameter in the constructor passes configuration details, such as the database connection string.
   - The `DbSet<Activity>` property represents a table in the database (pluralized as `Activities` by convention).
   - Use the `required` keyword to ensure the `DbSet` is not nullable, aligning with database requirements.
   - Import the `Activity` entity from the **domain** namespace, not `System.Diagnostics`.


## Configuring the DbContext in the API Project

### Steps
1. Open the `Program.cs` file in the **API** project.
2. Add the `AppDbContext` as a service with SQLite configuration:
   ```csharp
   builder.Services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(opt =>
   {
       opt.UseSqlite(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection"));
   });
   ```
3. **Explanation**:
   - `AddDbContext` registers the `AppDbContext` as a service for dependency injection.
   - `UseSqlite` specifies SQLite as the database provider.
   - `GetConnectionString` retrieves the connection string named `DefaultConnection` from configuration files.

## Setting Up the Connection String

### Configuration Files
- .NET looks for configuration in:
  - **Environment variables** (system-level).
  - **appsettings.json** (used in production and development).
  - **appsettings.Development.json** (used only in development mode).
- For non-sensitive data, use `appsettings.Development.json`.

### Adding the Connection String
1. Open `appsettings.Development.json`.
2. Add the connection string below the `Logging` section:
   ```json
   {
     "Logging": {
       "LogLevel": {
         "Default": "Information",
         "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Information"
       }
     },
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=Reactivities.db"
     }
   }
   ```
3. **Warning**: Connection strings are case-sensitive and typo-prone. Copy and paste the string name (`DefaultConnection`) and value (`Data Source=Reactivities.db`) to avoid errors.

## Creating Entity Framework Migrations

### Installing EF Tools
- Install the Entity Framework CLI tool globally:
  ```bash
  dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 9.0.0
  ```
- Verify installation by running:
  ```bash
  dotnet ef
  ```
  This displays the EF CLI help menu.

### Creating a Migration
1. Stop the running application to avoid build conflicts.
2. In the terminal, navigate to the solution directory.
3. Run the migration command:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -p Persistence -s API
   ```
   - `-p Persistence`: Specifies the project containing the `DbContext`.
   - `-s API`: Specifies the startup project.
4. **Result**: A `Migrations` folder is created in the **Persistence** project, containing:
   - `InitialCreate.cs`: Defines the database schema (e.g., creates the `Activities` table).
   - A model snapshot and designer file (used for migration tracking).

### Applying the Migration
1. Apply the migration to create the database:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update -p Persistence -s API
   ```
2. **Result**: Creates the `Reactivities.db` SQLite database and the `Activities` table with columns based on the `Activity` entity properties.

### Viewing the Database
- Use the SQLite Viewer extension in VS Code to inspect `Reactivities.db` in the **API** project.
- Confirm the `Activities` table and `_EFMigrationsHistory` table are created.

### Dropping the Database
- To drop the database (e.g., for a programmatic approach later):
  ```bash
  dotnet ef database drop -p Persistence -s API
  ```

## Key Commands Recap
- `dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite --version 9.0.0`: Installs SQLite support in the persistence project.
- `dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design --version 9.0.0`: Installs migration tools in the API project.
- `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 9.0.0`: Installs EF CLI tools.
- `dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -p Persistence -s API`: Creates a new migration.
- `dotnet ef database update -p Persistence -s API`: Applies migrations to create/update the database.
- `dotnet ef database drop -p Persistence -s API`: Drops the database.


# Configuring Connection Strings and Seeding Data

## Configuring the Connection String

### Definition
A connection string is a string that specifies the database connection details, such as the database type and location, used by Entity Framework to connect to the database.

## Setting Up the Connection String

### Configuration Sources
- **Environment Variables**: .NET checks system-level environment variables for configuration settings.
- **appsettings.json**: Used in both development and production environments.
- **appsettings.Development.json**: Used only in development mode, ideal for non-sensitive settings like connection strings.

### Adding the Connection String
1. Open `appsettings.Development.json` in the **API** project.
2. Add the connection string below the `Logging` section (ensure proper JSON formatting):
   ```json
   {
     "Logging": {
       "LogLevel": {
         "Default": "Information",
         "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Information"
       }
     },
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=Reactivities.db"
     }
   }
   ```
3. **Details**:
   - The connection string name (`DefaultConnection`) must match the name used in `Program.cs`.
   - For SQLite, the format is `Data Source=<database_name>.db` (e.g., `Reactivities.db`).
   - Set the logging level to `Information` to see detailed SQL queries generated by Entity Framework.

## Creating Entity Framework Migrations

### Installing EF CLI Tools
- Entity Framework CLI tools are required to manage migrations and are not included in the standard NuGet packages.
- Install globally in the terminal:
  ```bash
  dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 9.0.0
  ```
- Verify installation:
  ```bash
  dotnet ef
  ```
  This displays the EF CLI help menu.

### Creating a Migration
1. Stop the running application to avoid build conflicts.
2. Navigate to the solution directory in the terminal.
3. Run the migration command:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -p Persistence -s API
   ```
   - `-p Persistence`: Specifies the project containing the `DbContext`.
   - `-s API`: Specifies the startup project (API project).
4. **Result**: A `Migrations` folder is created in the **Persistence** project with:
   - `InitialCreate.cs`: Defines the schema (e.g., creates the `Activities` table based on the `Activity` entity).
   - A model snapshot and designer file for migration tracking.

### How Migrations Work
- Entity Framework uses conventions to map code to the database:
  - A `DbSet<Activity> Activities` creates a table named `Activities` (pluralized).
  - A property named `Id` is automatically set as the primary key.
  - Properties marked as `required` are non-nullable in the database.
- If the primary key is not named `Id`, use a `[Key]` data annotation to specify it explicitly.

### Applying the Migration
1. Apply the migration to create the database:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update -p Persistence -s API
   ```
2. **Result**:
   - Creates the `Reactivities.db` SQLite database in the **API** project.
   - Creates the `Activities` table with columns based on the `Activity` entity.
   - Creates an `_EFMigrationsHistory` table to track applied migrations.

### Viewing the Database
- Use the SQLite Viewer extension in VS Code to inspect `Reactivities.db`.
- Verify the `Activities` table and `_EFMigrationsHistory` table are created.

### Dropping the Database
- To drop the database (e.g., to switch to programmatic creation):
  ```bash
  dotnet ef database drop -p Persistence -s API
  ```

## Seeding Initial Data

### Creating a DbInitializer Class
1. In the **Persistence** project, create a new file named `DbInitializer.cs`.
2. Define a static method to seed data:
   ```csharp
   using Domain;
   using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
   using System.Collections.Generic;
   using System.Threading.Tasks;

   namespace Persistence
   {
       public class DbInitializer
       {
           public static async Task SeedData(AppDbContext context)
           {
               if (context.Activities.Any())
               {
                   return; // Exit if data exists
               }

               var activities = new List<Activity>
               {
                   new Activity { /* Properties */ },
                   // Add more activities from course assets
               };

               context.Activities.AddRange(activities);
               await context.SaveChangesAsync();
           }
       }
   }
   ```
3. **Key Points**:
   - The method is `static` to avoid instantiating `DbInitializer`.
   - `context.Activities.Any()` checks if the `Activities` table has data, exiting if true.
   - Use course-provided `seeddata.txt` (from lesson 4 resources) to populate the `activities` list with pre-defined `Activity` objects.
   - `AddRange` tracks entities in memory; `SaveChangesAsync` persists them to the database.

### Programmatic Database Creation and Seeding
1. Open `Program.cs` in the **API** project.
2. Add code to create the database and seed data using the service locator pattern:
   ```csharp
   using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
   using Persistence;

   var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
   // ... other service configurations
   builder.Services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(opt =>
   {
       opt.UseSqlite(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection"));
   });

   var app = builder.Build();
   // ... other middleware configurations
   app.MapControllers();

   using var scope = app.Services.CreateScope();
   var services = scope.ServiceProvider;
   try
   {
       var context = services.GetRequiredService<AppDbContext>();
       await context.Database.MigrateAsync(); // Applies migrations and creates database
       await DbInitializer.SeedData(context); // Seeds initial data
   }
   catch (Exception ex)
   {
       var logger = services.GetRequiredService<ILogger<Program>>();
       logger.LogError(ex, "An error occurred during migration");
   }

   app.Run();
   ```
3. **Explanation**:
   - `CreateScope` creates a service scope to access the `AppDbContext` service.
   - The `using` keyword ensures the scope is disposed of after use, preventing memory leaks.
   - `MigrateAsync` applies pending migrations and creates the database if it doesn’t exist.
   - `SeedData` populates the `Activities` table if empty.
   - The `try-catch` block logs errors during migration or seeding using `ILogger`.

### Running the Application
1. In the terminal, navigate to the **API** project:
   ```bash
   cd API
   ```
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet watch
   ```
3. Check the logs for SQL commands (e.g., `INSERT INTO`) indicating database creation and data seeding.
4. Use SQLite Viewer to confirm `Reactivities.db` contains the seeded `Activities` data.

## Key Commands Recap
- `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 9.0.0`: Installs EF CLI tools.
- `dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -p Persistence -s API`: Creates a new migration.
- `dotnet ef database update -p Persistence -s API`: Applies migrations to create/update the database.
- `dotnet ef database drop -p Persistence -s API`: Drops the database.
- `dotnet watch`: Runs the application with hot reload, applying migrations and seeding data.

# Querying the Database with API Controllers

## Introduction to API Controllers

### Definition
An API controller is a special class in .NET that handles incoming HTTP requests and sends back responses, like fetching data from a database and returning it as JSON.

### Purpose
API controllers allow your application to interact with the database over the web, enabling features like retrieving lists of activities or details of a single activity in a React app.

### Key Idea
API controllers act as the "doorway" for HTTP requests to access and query your database securely.

> **Analogy**: Think of an API controller as a librarian in a library (your database). When you ask for a book (data), the librarian checks the shelves and hands it back to you, without letting you wander the stacks yourself.

## Base API Controller Setup

### Creating the Base Class
- Use a template or create a new class called `BaseApiController.cs` in the Controllers folder.
- It inherits from `ControllerBase` (for APIs without views) and includes attributes for better developer experience.
- Example code:

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class BaseApiController : ControllerBase
{
    // This is a base class, so no methods needed here yet.
}
```

- The `[ApiController]` attribute improves API-building features, like automatic model validation.
- The `[Route("api/[controller]")]` sets a base URL pattern, where `[controller]` is replaced by the controller name (e.g., `/api/activities`).

## Activities Controller

### Inheriting from Base
- Create a new class `ActivitiesController.cs` in the Controllers folder.
- Inherit from `BaseApiController` to automatically get the attributes and routing.
- Example starter code:

```csharp
public class ActivitiesController : BaseApiController
{
    // Add endpoints here.
}
```

### Dependency Injection for DbContext
- Dependency injection (DI) lets the .NET framework automatically provide services like your database context (`AppDbContext`) to the controller.
- **Old Way (Boilerplate-heavy)**: Use a constructor to inject and assign to a field.
  - Example:

```csharp
private readonly AppDbContext _context;

public ActivitiesController(AppDbContext context)
{
    _context = context;
}
```

- **Modern Way (Primary Constructor)**: Simpler syntax for single constructors, reducing code.
  - Example:

```csharp
public class ActivitiesController(AppDbContext context) : BaseApiController
{
    // Use 'context' directly in methods.
}
```

- DI ensures the context is created when needed and disposed of after the request ends, like borrowing a tool that's returned automatically.

## HTTP GET Endpoints

### Fetching All Activities
- Add an `[HttpGet]` attribute for GET requests.
- Use async to make it scalable—frees up the main thread while waiting for the database.
- Example code:

```csharp
[HttpGet]
public async Task<ActionResult<List<Activity>>> GetActivities()
{
    return await context.Activities.ToListAsync();
}
```

- This queries the database for all activities and returns them as a list in the HTTP response.

### Fetching a Single Activity
- Add `{id}` in the route for a parameter (e.g., `/api/activities/{id}`).
- Use `FindAsync` to get by primary key (ID).
- Check for null to handle "not found" cases.
- Example code:

```csharp
[HttpGet("{id}")]
public async Task<ActionResult<Activity>> GetActivity(string id)
{
    var activity = await context.Activities.FindAsync(id);
    if (activity == null)
    {
        return NotFound();
    }
    return activity;
}
```

- Returns the activity if found, or a 404 NotFound response if not.

## Async Best Practices

### Why Use Async?
- Async prevents blocking the server's main thread during slow operations like database queries.
- Analogy: Instead of waiting in line at a coffee shop (blocking), you order and step aside while it's prepared, allowing others to order.

- In code, use `await` and `Task` for methods that involve waiting (e.g., database calls).
- Improves scalability for busy servers—avoids "server too busy" errors.

#  Saving Code to Source Control with Git and GitHub

## Introduction to Source Control

### Definition
Source control (version control) is a system for tracking and managing changes to code, allowing you to save, revert, and share your work safely.

### Purpose
Using Git and GitHub ensures your .NET and React project code is backed up, trackable, and shareable, protecting your work and enabling collaboration.

### Key Idea
Git lets you save snapshots of your code, while GitHub hosts it online for access and sharing.

> **Analogy**: Think of Git as a time machine for your code, letting you save versions and go back if needed, while GitHub is like a public library where you store and share those versions.

## Learning Goals
- Initialize a Git repository in your project to start tracking code changes.
- Use a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files (like compiled files or sensitive data) from source control.
- Commit and push code to a GitHub repository for safe storage and public sharing.
- Understand basic Git commands and workflows in Visual Studio Code.

## Setting Up Git

### Initializing a Repository
- In Visual Studio Code, go to the **Source Control** tab (sidebar, looks like a branch icon).
- If Git is installed, click **Initialize Repository** to create a local Git repository.
- This tracks all files in your project folder, showing changes (e.g., 249 files initially).

### Creating a .gitignore File
- Many project files (e.g., compiled `.dll` files, databases, or `appsettings.json`) shouldn’t be saved in source control.
- Use the .NET CLI to generate a `.gitignore` file tailored for .NET projects:
  ```bash
  dotnet new gitignore
  ```
- This reduces the number of tracked files (e.g., from 249 to 25) by excluding:
  - Compiled outputs (e.g., `.dll` files in `bin/` or `obj/` folders).
  - Local databases (e.g., `.sqlite` files) and their temporary files.
  - Sensitive files like `appsettings.json` (for API keys).

### Manually Excluding Files
- To exclude specific files (e.g., `appsettings.json` for API keys):
  - In VS Code’s Source Control tab, right-click the file and select **Add to .gitignore**.
  - This appends the file path (e.g., `/appsettings.json`) to the `.gitignore` file.
- Check `.gitignore` to confirm exclusions (e.g., database files or `appsettings.json`).

## Committing Changes

### Staging and Committing
- In the Source Control tab:
  - Click the **+** button to stage all changes (or stage specific files).
  - Enter a commit message (e.g., “End of Section 2”) to describe the changes.
  - Click the **Commit** button to save the changes locally.
- Commits are like saving a checkpoint of your code.

## Publishing to GitHub

### Setting Up a GitHub Repository
- Create a GitHub account if you don’t have one (visit github.com).
- Create a new repository:
  - Name it (e.g., `Reactivities` or `ReactivitiesV2`).
  - Set it to **Public** for sharing (only you can commit unless you grant access).
  - Skip adding a README for now; you can add it later.
- Copy the repository’s URL (e.g., `https://github.com/username/ReactivitiesV2.git`).

### Connecting Local Repo to GitHub
- In your terminal (at the project root):
  - Add the remote repository:
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/username/ReactivitiesV2.git
    ```
  - Verify the branch name (e.g., `main` or `master`):
    ```bash
    git branch
    ```
  - If using `master`, rename it to `main` (GitHub’s preferred default):
    ```bash
    git branch -m main
    ```

### Publishing the Code
- In VS Code’s Source Control tab, click **Publish Branch** (or use the cloud icon).
- Alternatively, in the terminal:
  ```bash
  git push -u origin main
  ```
- Refresh your GitHub repository page to confirm the code is uploaded.

## Key Commands Recap
- `dotnet new gitignore`: Creates a .NET-specific `.gitignore file`.
- `git init`: Initializes a local Git repository.
- `git branch -m main`: Renames the default branch to `main`.
- `git remote add origin <url>`: Links your local repo to GitHub.
- `git push -u origin main`: Publishes your code to GitHub.
