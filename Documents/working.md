# Section 2: Walking Skeleton Part 1 - API Focus (Continued)

## Lesson: Running the API Project

### Overview
- **Purpose**: Verify that the API project is set up correctly and can handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **Startup Project**: The `API` project is the entry point for running the application.

### Running the API
- **Steps**:
  - Open a terminal in VS Code (use the shortcut to toggle the terminal).
  - Navigate to the `API` directory:
    ```bash
    cd API
    ```
  - Run the project:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
  - The API starts on a random port (e.g., `http://localhost:5280`).
- **Result**: Visiting the URL in a browser shows "Page cannot be found" because it’s a Web API, not a web app with views.

### Understanding the API’s Role
- **What it Does**: Receives HTTP requests and returns HTTP responses via endpoints.
- **Default Endpoint**: The template includes a `WeatherForecastController` in the `Controllers` folder.
  - **Route**: `/weatherforecast` (derived from the controller name, omitting "Controller").
  - **Test**: Access `https://localhost:<port>/weatherforecast` in a browser to see a JSON response with weather data.
- **Purpose of Test**: Confirms the API server is running and responding to requests.

### Configuring the Port
- **File**: `Properties/launchSettings.json` controls how the API starts.
- **Default Setup**:
  - Contains profiles for `http` and `https`.
  - The first profile (e.g., `http://localhost:5280`) is used by default.
- **Customization**:
  - Edit `launchSettings.json` to use a fixed port (e.g., `https://localhost:5001`) for consistency.
  - Remove the `http` profile and use only `https` for security (required for authentication later).
  - Example modification:
    ```json
    {
      "profiles": {
        "https": {
          "commandName": "Project",
          "dotnetRunMessages": true,
          "launchBrowser": false,
          "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:5001",
          "environmentVariables": {
            "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
- **Why HTTPS?**: Matches production settings and supports authentication.
- **Self-Signed Certificate**: .NET uses a self-signed certificate for HTTPS in development. If browser security warnings appear, follow the troubleshooting guide provided in the course resources.

### Using `dotnet watch`
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  dotnet watch
  ```
- **Purpose**: Runs the API with a file watcher that detects code changes and reloads the application.
- **Hot Reload**: Automatically applies some code changes without restarting, but API projects may require manual restarts for certain changes.
- **Benefit**: Simplifies development by updating the running application when code changes.

### Simplifying the Project
- **Remove Unnecessary Files**:
  - Delete `WeatherForecast.cs` (example code not needed).
  - Delete `http.api` file (used for testing endpoints in VS Code, but Postman is preferred).
- **Simplify `Program.cs`**:
  - **Purpose**: Configures services and the HTTP request pipeline.
  - **Services Section**: Defines services (e.g., controllers) using dependency injection.
    - Removed `AddSwaggerGen` (OpenAPI) as it’s not used.
    - Kept `AddControllers` to enable API controllers.
  - **HTTP Request Pipeline**: Processes incoming requests via middleware.
    - Removed `UseHttpsRedirection` and `UseAuthorization` (not needed yet).
    - Kept `MapControllers` for routing requests to controllers.
  - **Example `Program.cs`**:
    ```csharp
    var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

    // Services
    builder.Services.AddControllers();

    var app = builder.Build();

    // HTTP Request Pipeline
    app.UseRouting();
    app.MapControllers();

    app.Run();
    ```
- **Why Simplify?**: Removes unused features to focus on core functionality.

### Key Files
- **Program.cs**:
  - Entry point for the API, equivalent to a `Main` method (hidden in modern .NET templates).
  - Configures services (e.g., controllers) and the HTTP request pipeline (middleware).
- **API.csproj**:
  - Defines the project’s target framework (e.g., .NET 9) and settings.
  - Includes `<Nullable>enable</Nullable>` for nullable reference types (explained later).
- **Controllers Folder**: Contains API controllers for handling endpoints.

## Lesson: Creating the First Domain Entity

### Overview
- **Purpose**: Create the `Activity` entity in the `Domain` project, representing

# Section: Setting Up the DbContext and Entity Framework

## Introduction to DbContext

### Definition
The `DbContext` class in Entity Framework Core is a critical component that represents a session with the database, enabling querying and saving of data for your application's entities.

### Purpose
The `DbContext` acts as a bridge between your .NET application and the database, managed by Entity Framework Core, which is an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that simplifies database interactions.

### Key Idea
The `DbContext` manages database connections and incorporates the Unit of Work and Repository patterns for efficient data access.

> **Analogy**: Think of the `DbContext` as a librarian who organizes and retrieves books (data) from a library (database) for you, keeping track of your requests and updates.

## Learning Goals
- Understand the role of the `DbContext` in connecting a .NET application to a database.
- Install necessary NuGet packages for Entity Framework Core and SQLite.
- Create a custom `DbContext` class and configure it for use with SQLite.
- Set up Entity Framework migrations to create and manage database schema.

## Installing Required NuGet Packages

### Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite
- **Purpose**: Enables Entity Framework Core to work with SQLite databases.
- **Installation**:
  - Use the NuGet Gallery extension in VS Code or the Package Manager in Visual Studio/Rider.
  - In the terminal, navigate to the **persistence** project and run:
    ```bash
    dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite --version 9.0.0
    ```
  - **Important**: Ensure the package version matches your .NET runtime (e.g., 9.0 for .NET 9). Select `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite`, not `Sqlite.Core`, to avoid issues.

### Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
- **Purpose**: Provides tools for creating and managing Entity Framework migrations in the **API** (startup) project.
- **Installation**:
  - In the terminal, navigate to the **API** project and run:
    ```bash
    dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design --version 9.0.0
    ```
  - This package is essential for running migration commands.

## Creating the AppDbContext Class

### Steps
1. In the **persistence** project, create a new file named `AppDbContext.cs`.
2. Define the `AppDbContext` class, inheriting from `DbContext`:
   ```csharp
   using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

   namespace Persistence
   {
       public class AppDbContext : DbContext
       {
           public AppDbContext(DbContextOptions options) : base(options)
           {
           }

           public required DbSet<Activity> Activities { get; set; }
       }
   }
   ```
3. **Key Points**:
   - The `DbContextOptions` parameter in the constructor passes configuration details, such as the database connection string.
   - The `DbSet<Activity>` property represents a table in the database (pluralized as `Activities` by convention).
   - Use the `required` keyword to ensure the `DbSet` is not nullable, aligning with database requirements.
   - Import the `Activity` entity from the **domain** namespace, not `System.Diagnostics`.

### Quick Fix in VS Code
- If you see a namespace suggestion (e.g., a light bulb or ellipsis), use the quick fix (Ctrl + . or Cmd + .) to set the namespace to `Persistence` or import required namespaces automatically.

## Configuring the DbContext in the API Project

### Steps
1. Open the `Program.cs` file in the **API** project.
2. Add the `AppDbContext` as a service with SQLite configuration:
   ```csharp
   builder.Services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(opt =>
   {
       opt.UseSqlite(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection"));
   });
   ```
3. **Explanation**:
   - `AddDbContext` registers the `AppDbContext` as a service for dependency injection.
   - `UseSqlite` specifies SQLite as the database provider.
   - `GetConnectionString` retrieves the connection string named `DefaultConnection` from configuration files.

## Setting Up the Connection String

### Configuration Files
- .NET looks for configuration in:
  - **Environment variables** (system-level).
  - **appsettings.json** (used in production and development).
  - **appsettings.Development.json** (used only in development mode).
- For non-sensitive data, use `appsettings.Development.json`.

### Adding the Connection String
1. Open `appsettings.Development.json`.
2. Add the connection string below the `Logging` section:
   ```json
   {
     "Logging": {
       "LogLevel": {
         "Default": "Information",
         "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Information"
       }
     },
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=Reactivities.db"
     }
   }
   ```
3. **Warning**: Connection strings are case-sensitive and typo-prone. Copy and paste the string name (`DefaultConnection`) and value (`Data Source=Reactivities.db`) to avoid errors.

## Creating Entity Framework Migrations

### Installing EF Tools
- Install the Entity Framework CLI tool globally:
  ```bash
  dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 9.0.0
  ```
- Verify installation by running:
  ```bash
  dotnet ef
  ```
  This displays the EF CLI help menu.

### Creating a Migration
1. Stop the running application to avoid build conflicts.
2. In the terminal, navigate to the solution directory.
3. Run the migration command:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -p Persistence -s API
   ```
   - `-p Persistence`: Specifies the project containing the `DbContext`.
   - `-s API`: Specifies the startup project.
4. **Result**: A `Migrations` folder is created in the **Persistence** project, containing:
   - `InitialCreate.cs`: Defines the database schema (e.g., creates the `Activities` table).
   - A model snapshot and designer file (used for migration tracking).

### Applying the Migration
1. Apply the migration to create the database:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update -p Persistence -s API
   ```
2. **Result**: Creates the `Reactivities.db` SQLite database and the `Activities` table with columns based on the `Activity` entity properties.

### Viewing the Database
- Use the SQLite Viewer extension in VS Code to inspect `Reactivities.db` in the **API** project.
- Confirm the `Activities` table and `_EFMigrationsHistory` table are created.

### Dropping the Database
- To drop the database (e.g., for a programmatic approach later):
  ```bash
  dotnet ef database drop -p Persistence -s API
  ```

## Key Commands Recap
- `dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite --version 9.0.0`: Installs SQLite support in the persistence project.
- `dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design --version 9.0.0`: Installs migration tools in the API project.
- `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 9.0.0`: Installs EF CLI tools.
- `dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -p Persistence -s API`: Creates a new migration.
- `dotnet ef database update -p Persistence -s API`: Applies migrations to create/update the database.
- `dotnet ef database drop -p Persistence -s API`: Drops the database.

## Tips for Beginners
- **Match Package Versions**: Always use the Entity Framework package version that matches your .NET runtime to avoid compatibility issues.
- **Avoid Typos in Connection Strings**: Copy and paste connection string names and values to prevent errors, as strings lack compiler validation.
- **Stop the Application Before Migrations**: Running migrations while the app is active can cause build failures.
- **Use Conventions**: Name primary key properties `Id` to leverage Entity Framework’s convention-based mapping, reducing manual configuration.
- **Check SQLite Viewer**: Use the SQLite Viewer extension to verify your database schema after applying migrations.

## Next Steps
- Learn how to seed initial data into the database.
- Explore programmatic database creation instead of manual migration application.
- Understand how to configure additional Entity Framework features, such as data annotations or fluent API.

These notes are designed to be beginner-friendly, breaking down the setup of the `DbContext` and Entity Framework migrations with clear explanations, code snippets, and practical tips. Let me know if you need further clarification or additional sections from the course transcript!

Below are beginner-friendly notes in Markdown format based on the provided transcript from a Udemy course on .NET and React, focusing on configuring the connection string, creating Entity Framework migrations, and seeding initial data into the database. The notes are structured to be clear, concise, and aligned with the specified style guide, emphasizing key concepts for beginners.

# Section: Configuring Connection Strings and Seeding Data

## Configuring the Connection String

### Definition
A connection string is a string that specifies the database connection details, such as the database type and location, used by Entity Framework to connect to the database.

### Purpose
Connection strings allow the application to locate and interact with the database, and they are typically stored in configuration files like `appsettings.Development.json` for easy management.

### Key Idea
The connection string must be correctly formatted and consistent across the application to ensure successful database connections.

> **Analogy**: A connection string is like the address and key to your house (database)—it tells the application where to find the database and how to access it.

## Learning Goals
- Understand where .NET looks for configuration settings (e.g., environment variables, `appsettings.json`).
- Configure a connection string for SQLite in `appsettings.Development.json`.
- Install Entity Framework CLI tools to manage migrations.
- Create and apply migrations to set up the database schema.
- Seed initial data into the database programmatically when the application starts.

## Setting Up the Connection String

### Configuration Sources
- **Environment Variables**: .NET checks system-level environment variables for configuration settings.
- **appsettings.json**: Used in both development and production environments.
- **appsettings.Development.json**: Used only in development mode, ideal for non-sensitive settings like connection strings.

### Adding the Connection String
1. Open `appsettings.Development.json` in the **API** project.
2. Add the connection string below the `Logging` section (ensure proper JSON formatting):
   ```json
   {
     "Logging": {
       "LogLevel": {
         "Default": "Information",
         "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Information"
       }
     },
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=Reactivities.db"
     }
   }
   ```
3. **Details**:
   - The connection string name (`DefaultConnection`) must match the name used in `Program.cs`.
   - For SQLite, the format is `Data Source=<database_name>.db` (e.g., `Reactivities.db`).
   - Set the logging level to `Information` to see detailed SQL queries generated by Entity Framework.

### Warning: Typos in Strings
- Connection strings are case-sensitive and lack compiler validation.
- **Tip**: Copy and paste the connection string name and value between `Program.cs` and `appsettings.Development.json` to avoid typos.
- Example of an incorrect connection string:
  ```json
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Data Sorce=Reactivities.db" // Typo: "Sorce" instead of "Source"
  }
  ```
  This will cause runtime errors that are hard to diagnose until the application starts.

## Creating Entity Framework Migrations

### Installing EF CLI Tools
- Entity Framework CLI tools are required to manage migrations and are not included in the standard NuGet packages.
- Install globally in the terminal:
  ```bash
  dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 9.0.0
  ```
- Verify installation:
  ```bash
  dotnet ef
  ```
  This displays the EF CLI help menu.

### Creating a Migration
1. Stop the running application to avoid build conflicts.
2. Navigate to the solution directory in the terminal.
3. Run the migration command:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -p Persistence -s API
   ```
   - `-p Persistence`: Specifies the project containing the `DbContext`.
   - `-s API`: Specifies the startup project (API project).
4. **Result**: A `Migrations` folder is created in the **Persistence** project with:
   - `InitialCreate.cs`: Defines the schema (e.g., creates the `Activities` table based on the `Activity` entity).
   - A model snapshot and designer file for migration tracking.

### How Migrations Work
- Entity Framework uses conventions to map code to the database:
  - A `DbSet<Activity> Activities` creates a table named `Activities` (pluralized).
  - A property named `Id` is automatically set as the primary key.
  - Properties marked as `required` are non-nullable in the database.
- If the primary key is not named `Id`, use a `[Key]` data annotation to specify it explicitly.

### Applying the Migration
1. Apply the migration to create the database:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update -p Persistence -s API
   ```
2. **Result**:
   - Creates the `Reactivities.db` SQLite database in the **API** project.
   - Creates the `Activities` table with columns based on the `Activity` entity.
   - Creates an `_EFMigrationsHistory` table to track applied migrations.

### Viewing the Database
- Use the SQLite Viewer extension in VS Code to inspect `Reactivities.db`.
- Verify the `Activities` table and `_EFMigrationsHistory` table are created.

### Dropping the Database
- To drop the database (e.g., to switch to programmatic creation):
  ```bash
  dotnet ef database drop -p Persistence -s API
  ```

## Seeding Initial Data

### Creating a DbInitializer Class
1. In the **Persistence** project, create a new file named `DbInitializer.cs`.
2. Define a static method to seed data:
   ```csharp
   using Domain;
   using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
   using System.Collections.Generic;
   using System.Threading.Tasks;

   namespace Persistence
   {
       public class DbInitializer
       {
           public static async Task SeedData(AppDbContext context)
           {
               if (context.Activities.Any())
               {
                   return; // Exit if data exists
               }

               var activities = new List<Activity>
               {
                   new Activity { /* Properties */ },
                   // Add more activities from course assets
               };

               context.Activities.AddRange(activities);
               await context.SaveChangesAsync();
           }
       }
   }
   ```
3. **Key Points**:
   - The method is `static` to avoid instantiating `DbInitializer`.
   - `context.Activities.Any()` checks if the `Activities` table has data, exiting if true.
   - Use course-provided `seeddata.txt` (from lesson 4 resources) to populate the `activities` list with pre-defined `Activity` objects.
   - `AddRange` tracks entities in memory; `SaveChangesAsync` persists them to the database.

### Programmatic Database Creation and Seeding
1. Open `Program.cs` in the **API** project.
2. Add code to create the database and seed data using the service locator pattern:
   ```csharp
   using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
   using Persistence;

   var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
   // ... other service configurations
   builder.Services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(opt =>
   {
       opt.UseSqlite(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection"));
   });

   var app = builder.Build();
   // ... other middleware configurations
   app.MapControllers();

   using var scope = app.Services.CreateScope();
   var services = scope.ServiceProvider;
   try
   {
       var context = services.GetRequiredService<AppDbContext>();
       await context.Database.MigrateAsync(); // Applies migrations and creates database
       await DbInitializer.SeedData(context); // Seeds initial data
   }
   catch (Exception ex)
   {
       var logger = services.GetRequiredService<ILogger<Program>>();
       logger.LogError(ex, "An error occurred during migration");
   }

   app.Run();
   ```
3. **Explanation**:
   - `CreateScope` creates a service scope to access the `AppDbContext` service.
   - The `using` keyword ensures the scope is disposed of after use, preventing memory leaks.
   - `MigrateAsync` applies pending migrations and creates the database if it doesn’t exist.
   - `SeedData` populates the `Activities` table if empty.
   - The `try-catch` block logs errors during migration or seeding using `ILogger`.

### Running the Application
1. In the terminal, navigate to the **API** project:
   ```bash
   cd API
   ```
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet watch
   ```
3. Check the logs for SQL commands (e.g., `INSERT INTO`) indicating database creation and data seeding.
4. Use SQLite Viewer to confirm `Reactivities.db` contains the seeded `Activities` data.

## Key Commands Recap
- `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 9.0.0`: Installs EF CLI tools.
- `dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -p Persistence -s API`: Creates a new migration.
- `dotnet ef database update -p Persistence -s API`: Applies migrations to create/update the database.
- `dotnet ef database drop -p Persistence -s API`: Drops the database.
- `dotnet watch`: Runs the application with hot reload, applying migrations and seeding data.

## Tips for Beginners
- **Use Development Configuration**: Store non-sensitive settings like connection strings in `appsettings.Development.json` to keep them separate from production settings.
- **Copy-Paste Strings**: Avoid typos by copying connection string names and values between `Program.cs` and configuration files.
- **Stop the App for Migrations**: Always stop the running application before running migration commands to avoid build errors.
- **Leverage Conventions**: Use Entity Framework’s conventions (e.g., naming a primary key `Id`) to reduce manual configuration.
- **Check Logs**: Set the logging level to `Information` to debug SQL queries generated by Entity Framework.
- **Use Course Assets**: Download `seeddata.txt` from lesson 4 resources to avoid manually creating seed data.

## Next Steps
- Create an API controller to query the seeded data and return it to the client.
- Learn about dependency injection for accessing the `AppDbContext` in controllers.
- Explore how to handle asynchronous operations in Entity Framework.

# Section 3: Querying the Database with API Controllers

## Introduction to API Controllers

### Definition
An API controller is a special class in .NET that handles incoming HTTP requests and sends back responses, like fetching data from a database and returning it as JSON.

### Purpose
API controllers allow your application to interact with the database over the web, enabling features like retrieving lists of activities or details of a single activity in a React app.

### Key Idea
API controllers act as the "doorway" for HTTP requests to access and query your database securely.

> **Analogy**: Think of an API controller as a librarian in a library (your database). When you ask for a book (data), the librarian checks the shelves and hands it back to you, without letting you wander the stacks yourself.

## Learning Goals
- Understand how to set up a base API controller to reuse common attributes and reduce repetitive code.
- Learn to inject database access (DbContext) into controllers using dependency injection.
- Create HTTP GET endpoints to fetch all activities or a single one asynchronously.
- Recognize the importance of async operations for scalability and best practices in web APIs.

## Base API Controller Setup

### Creating the Base Class
- Use a template or create a new class called `BaseApiController.cs` in the Controllers folder.
- It inherits from `ControllerBase` (for APIs without views) and includes attributes for better developer experience.
- Example code:

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class BaseApiController : ControllerBase
{
    // This is a base class, so no methods needed here yet.
}
```

- The `[ApiController]` attribute improves API-building features, like automatic model validation.
- The `[Route("api/[controller]")]` sets a base URL pattern, where `[controller]` is replaced by the controller name (e.g., `/api/activities`).

## Activities Controller

### Inheriting from Base
- Create a new class `ActivitiesController.cs` in the Controllers folder.
- Inherit from `BaseApiController` to automatically get the attributes and routing.
- Example starter code:

```csharp
public class ActivitiesController : BaseApiController
{
    // Add endpoints here.
}
```

### Dependency Injection for DbContext
- Dependency injection (DI) lets the .NET framework automatically provide services like your database context (`AppDbContext`) to the controller.
- **Old Way (Boilerplate-heavy)**: Use a constructor to inject and assign to a field.
  - Example:

```csharp
private readonly AppDbContext _context;

public ActivitiesController(AppDbContext context)
{
    _context = context;
}
```

- **Modern Way (Primary Constructor)**: Simpler syntax for single constructors, reducing code.
  - Example:

```csharp
public class ActivitiesController(AppDbContext context) : BaseApiController
{
    // Use 'context' directly in methods.
}
```

- DI ensures the context is created when needed and disposed of after the request ends, like borrowing a tool that's returned automatically.

## HTTP GET Endpoints

### Fetching All Activities
- Add an `[HttpGet]` attribute for GET requests.
- Use async to make it scalable—frees up the main thread while waiting for the database.
- Example code:

```csharp
[HttpGet]
public async Task<ActionResult<List<Activity>>> GetActivities()
{
    return await context.Activities.ToListAsync();
}
```

- This queries the database for all activities and returns them as a list in the HTTP response.

### Fetching a Single Activity
- Add `{id}` in the route for a parameter (e.g., `/api/activities/{id}`).
- Use `FindAsync` to get by primary key (ID).
- Check for null to handle "not found" cases.
- Example code:

```csharp
[HttpGet("{id}")]
public async Task<ActionResult<Activity>> GetActivity(string id)
{
    var activity = await context.Activities.FindAsync(id);
    if (activity == null)
    {
        return NotFound();
    }
    return activity;
}
```

- Returns the activity if found, or a 404 NotFound response if not.

## Async Best Practices

### Why Use Async?
- Async prevents blocking the server's main thread during slow operations like database queries.
- Analogy: Instead of waiting in line at a coffee shop (blocking), you order and step aside while it's prepared, allowing others to order.

- In code, use `await` and `Task` for methods that involve waiting (e.g., database calls).
- Improves scalability for busy servers—avoids "server too busy" errors.

## Testing API Endpoints

### In Browser
- Navigate to `/api/activities` for all, or `/api/activities/{id}` for one.
- Refresh after changes; restart the server if 404 persists.

### Troubleshooting
- Always restart the API server (Ctrl+R in terminal) when adding new controllers—it rebuilds and registers them.
- Hot reload works for minor changes like new endpoints, but not always for new files.

## Key Commands Recap
- `dotnet run`: Start or restart the API server.
- Browser URL: `http://localhost:5000/api/activities` (adjust port as needed).

## Tips for Beginners
- Double-check imports: Ensure `Activity` is from your Domain project, not elsewhere, to avoid type mismatches.
- Watch for null warnings: Always handle cases where data might not exist to prevent runtime errors.
- Use async everywhere for database ops—it's a habit that pays off as your app grows.
- If stuck with 404s, restart the server first; it's the quickest fix for many issues.

# Section 4: Saving Code to Source Control with Git and GitHub

## Introduction to Source Control

### Definition
Source control (version control) is a system for tracking and managing changes to code, allowing you to save, revert, and share your work safely.

### Purpose
Using Git and GitHub ensures your .NET and React project code is backed up, trackable, and shareable, protecting your work and enabling collaboration.

### Key Idea
Git lets you save snapshots of your code, while GitHub hosts it online for access and sharing.

> **Analogy**: Think of Git as a time machine for your code, letting you save versions and go back if needed, while GitHub is like a public library where you store and share those versions.

## Learning Goals
- Initialize a Git repository in your project to start tracking code changes.
- Use a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files (like compiled files or sensitive data) from source control.
- Commit and push code to a GitHub repository for safe storage and public sharing.
- Understand basic Git commands and workflows in Visual Studio Code.

## Setting Up Git

### Initializing a Repository
- In Visual Studio Code, go to the **Source Control** tab (sidebar, looks like a branch icon).
- If Git is installed, click **Initialize Repository** to create a local Git repository.
- This tracks all files in your project folder, showing changes (e.g., 249 files initially).

### Creating a .gitignore File
- Many project files (e.g., compiled `.dll` files, databases, or `appsettings.json`) shouldn’t be saved in source control.
- Use the .NET CLI to generate a `.gitignore` file tailored for .NET projects:
  ```bash
  dotnet new gitignore
  ```
- This reduces the number of tracked files (e.g., from 249 to 25) by excluding:
  - Compiled outputs (e.g., `.dll` files in `bin/` or `obj/` folders).
  - Local databases (e.g., `.sqlite` files) and their temporary files.
  - Sensitive files like `appsettings.json` (for API keys).

### Manually Excluding Files
- To exclude specific files (e.g., `appsettings.json` for API keys):
  - In VS Code’s Source Control tab, right-click the file and select **Add to .gitignore**.
  - This appends the file path (e.g., `/appsettings.json`) to the `.gitignore` file.
- Check `.gitignore` to confirm exclusions (e.g., database files or `appsettings.json`).

## Committing Changes

### Staging and Committing
- In the Source Control tab:
  - Click the **+** button to stage all changes (or stage specific files).
  - Enter a commit message (e.g., “End of Section 2”) to describe the changes.
  - Click the **Commit** button to save the changes locally.
- Commits are like saving a checkpoint of your code.

## Publishing to GitHub

### Setting Up a GitHub Repository
- Create a GitHub account if you don’t have one (visit github.com).
- Create a new repository:
  - Name it (e.g., `Reactivities` or `ReactivitiesV2`).
  - Set it to **Public** for sharing (only you can commit unless you grant access).
  - Skip adding a README for now; you can add it later.
- Copy the repository’s URL (e.g., `https://github.com/username/ReactivitiesV2.git`).

### Connecting Local Repo to GitHub
- In your terminal (at the project root):
  - Add the remote repository:
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/username/ReactivitiesV2.git
    ```
  - Verify the branch name (e.g., `main` or `master`):
    ```bash
    git branch
    ```
  - If using `master`, rename it to `main` (GitHub’s preferred default):
    ```bash
    git branch -m main
    ```

### Publishing the Code
- In VS Code’s Source Control tab, click **Publish Branch** (or use the cloud icon).
- Alternatively, in the terminal:
  ```bash
  git push -u origin main
  ```
- Refresh your GitHub repository page to confirm the code is uploaded.

## Key Commands Recap
- `dotnet new gitignore`: Creates a .NET-specific `.gitignore file`.
- `git init`: Initializes a local Git repository.
- `git branch -m main`: Renames the default branch to `main`.
- `git remote add origin <url>`: Links your local repo to GitHub.
- `git push -u origin main`: Publishes your code to GitHub.

## Tips for Beginners
- Always check `.gitignore` before committing to avoid uploading sensitive or unnecessary files.
- Use clear commit messages (e.g., “Added API controllers”) to track what changed.
- If files like `.sqlite` disappear from the Source Control tab, re-add them to `.gitignore` when they reappear.
- Restart VS Code or your terminal if Git commands don’t work—ensures Git is properly initialized.
- For Windows users, search for “zsh for Windows” to get a terminal like `oh-my-zsh` (Mac’s default) for branch visibility.
