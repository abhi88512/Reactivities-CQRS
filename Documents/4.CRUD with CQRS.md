## Overview

### Definition
Clean Architecture is a way to organize software applications so that the most important parts (like business rules) are protected from changes in tools or interfaces. It was created by Robert C. Martin (also known as "Uncle Bob") in 2012. Think of it like an onion with layers: the center holds the core ideas, and outer layers handle details like databases or user interfaces.

### Purpose
This architecture helps build apps that are easy to maintain, test, and change over time. It ensures that the "heart" of your app (business logic) doesn't depend on external things like specific databases or web frameworks, making your code more flexible.

### Key Idea
Dependencies (how parts of the code rely on each other) always point inward toward the center, keeping the core business rules isolated and unaware of outer details.

> **Analogy**: Imagine a castle—the king (business rules) is in the center, protected by walls (layers). Guards (outer layers) handle visitors (databases or UIs), but the king doesn't need to know about them.

## Learning Goals
- Understand the layers of Clean Architecture and how they map to a .NET and React app.
- Learn why separating concerns (like business logic from UI) makes apps more robust.
- Recognize how this setup supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in a simple app.

## Layers of Clean Architecture

### Entities (Center Layer)
- This is the "domain" layer in your .NET project.
- Contains basic business objects, like an "Activity" class in the example app.
- Focuses on core data and rules shared across the app (or even an entire company).
- Beginner note: These are like the building blocks of your app's world—simple objects without fancy tech.

### Use Cases (Next Layer Out)
- Maps to the "application" project in .NET.
- Holds all the business logic, like getting a list of activities or editing one.
- Each action (use case) gets its own class and handler.
- Isolated from the UI—doesn't care if it's React, console, or something else.
- In the example: Add classes for create, edit, and delete activities to handle CRUD.

### Interface Adapters
- Acts as a bridge between business logic and tech-specific code.
- In this app: Your API controllers in .NET.
- They fetch data from the application layer and send it back to the client.

### Frameworks and Drivers (Outer Layer)
- Includes the UI (like React) and database.
- The inner layers don't know about these—swap React for Angular without changing core code.
- Beginner note: This layer is like the "skin" of the app; it can change without affecting the "brain" inside.

## Clean Architecture Recommendations

### Independent from Frameworks
- The architecture works with any tech, like .NET, but the principles are universal.

### Testable
- Business logic can be tested alone, without needing a database or UI.

### Independent from UI
- Change from React to a console app without rewriting core logic.

### Independent from Database
- Core doesn't know the database type, but you might still use tools like Entity Framework (ORM) for queries.
- These are guidelines—bend them based on your tools.


# Flow of Control and Mediator Pattern

## Overview

### Definition
Flow of Control describes how data moves through the layers: from the API (outer) to the business logic (inner) and back. The Mediator pattern is a tool that handles this by routing requests to the right handlers.

### Purpose
It ensures smooth communication between layers without tight coupling—your API sends a request, Mediator routes it, and gets a response back.

### Key Idea
API controllers receive requests, use Mediator to process them in the application layer, and return results—keeping everything organized.

> **Analogy**: Mediator is like a receptionist in an office: You (API) ask for something, they forward it to the right person (handler), and bring back the answer.

## Learning Goals
- See how Mediator fits into Clean Architecture for handling use cases.
- Understand the difference between sending queries (get data) and commands (change data).

## How Mediator Works
- API controller gets an HTTP request from the client (e.g., React app).
- Controller uses Mediator's "Send" method to pass a query or command to a handler in the application layer.
- Handler processes the logic (e.g., fetch an activity).
- Returns the result back to the controller, which sends an HTTP response.
- Beginner note: Think of it as a messenger service—no direct talking between layers.

## Tips for Beginners
- Don't overthink: Mediator simplifies code by avoiding direct calls between classes.
- When coding: Look for "Mediator.Send()" in your .NET controllers— that's the key spot.
- Common pitfall: Forgetting to register handlers; always check your setup.

# Section 3: CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

## Overview

### Definition
CQRS is a pattern that separates "commands" (actions that change things) from "queries" (requests for information). It's about splitting how you handle updates versus reads.

### Purpose
It makes apps more scalable and organized, especially for larger systems. Even in simple apps, it clarifies code by treating changes and reads differently.

### Key Idea
Commands change state but don't return data; queries return data but don't change anything—splitting one flow into two.

> **Analogy**: Commands are like writing a letter (you send it and change something, no reply needed). Queries are like asking a question (you get an answer, but nothing changes).

## Learning Goals
- Differentiate commands and queries in CRUD operations.
- Appreciate scalability benefits, even if not using them fully in a basic app.

## Commands vs. Queries

### Commands
- Do something: Modify the app's state (e.g., create, edit, or delete an activity).
- No return value—just confirm it happened.
- In the app: Use for updating the database.

### Queries
- Answer a question: Get data without changes (e.g., list activities or get details of one).
- Always return a value.
- In the app: Use for reading from the database.

## Scalability Scenarios

### Single Database (Like This App)
- Both commands and queries use the same database (via Entity Framework).
- Performance is standard—no big gains, but follows good principles.

### Separate Databases (Advanced)
- Write database: Normalized (structured tables) for commands.
- Read database: Denormalized (flatter data) or NoSQL (like MongoDB) for fast queries.
- Use "eventual consistency" to sync data between them.
- Benefit: Faster reads, easier scaling for big apps.

## Key Commands Recap
- No specific CLI commands here, but in .NET: Use Mediator.Send() for commands like "CreateActivity".

## Tips for Beginners
- Start simple: In your code, name classes clearly—like "CreateActivityCommand" vs. "GetActivitiesQuery".
- Avoid mixing: Never let a query change data—that breaks the pattern.
- Think future-proof: Even with one DB now, this setup makes it easy to split later for growth.

# Section 1: Introducing the Mediator Pattern in the Application Layer

## Overview

### Definition
The Mediator pattern is a design tool that acts as a "middleman" between different parts of your app, allowing them to communicate without directly depending on each other. In this .NET app, it helps the API layer send requests to the application layer (where business logic lives) and get responses back, even though the application layer doesn't directly reference the API.

### Purpose
Mediator keeps your code organized and decoupled—meaning changes in one layer (like the API) won't break the other. It's key for following Clean Architecture by handling use cases (like fetching data) in a structured way.

### Key Idea
The API sends a request via Mediator, which routes it to a handler in the application layer; the handler processes the logic and returns the result.

> **Analogy**: Think of Mediator as a translator at a meeting—Person A (API) speaks to the translator, who passes the message to Person B (application layer) and brings back the reply. No direct talking needed!

## Learning Goals
- Understand how Mediator solves one-way dependency issues between layers.
- Learn to install and configure the MediatR package in a .NET project.
- See why thin controllers (with minimal logic) make apps easier to maintain.

## Installing MediatR

- Open your terminal in Visual Studio (or use NuGet Package Manager Console).
- Search for and install the "MediatR" package (version 12.4.1 in the transcript) into the **application** project.
  - Command: `dotnet add package MediatR`
- This package handles requests and responses; your API project can access it because it depends on the application project.

## Configuring MediatR in Program.cs

- In your `Program.cs` file, add MediatR as a service:
  ```csharp
  builder.Services.AddMediatR(cfg => cfg.RegisterServicesFromAssemblyContaining<GetActivityList.Handler>());
  ```
- This tells MediatR where to find your handlers (classes that process requests). Use one handler's type to register all in the assembly.

## Tips for Beginners
- If your API restarts often: Hot reload in .NET isn't perfect—always check the terminal and restart manually if things don't work.
- Ignore annoying files: Add SQLite temp files to `.gitignore` to avoid clutter in commits.
- Common pitfall: Forgetting to restart the API after changes—test in Postman to confirm.

# Section 2: Creating Query Handlers for Reading Data

## Overview

### Definition
Query handlers are classes in the application layer that process "read" requests (queries) using MediatR. They fetch data from the database without changing it, following CQRS principles.

### Purpose
Handlers encapsulate business logic for use cases like listing activities or getting details, keeping it separate from the API.

### Key Idea
Each handler has a `Query` class (for input parameters) and a `Handler` class (for processing and returning data).

> **Analogy**: A handler is like a librarian—you ask (query) for a book by title (parameters), and they fetch it without altering the library.

## Learning Goals
- Build handlers for listing and detailing activities.
- Use Entity Framework to query the database asynchronously.
- Handle parameters like IDs in queries.

## Folder Structure for Features
- In the **application** project:
  - Create a folder for each feature (e.g., `Activities`).
  - Inside, add subfolders like `Queries` for read operations.
- Example: Delete unused files like `Class1.cs` to keep it clean.

## Handler for Listing Activities (GetActivityList.cs)

- Create a new class file in `Activities/Queries`.
```csharp
using MediatR;
using Domain; // For Activity class
using Persistence; // For AppDbContext

namespace Application.Activities.Queries
{
    public class GetActivityList
    {
        public class Query : IRequest<List<Activity>> { } // No parameters needed

        public class Handler : IRequestHandler<Query, List<Activity>>
        {
            private readonly AppDbContext _context;

            public Handler(AppDbContext context)
            {
                _context = context;
            }

            public async Task<List<Activity>> Handle(Query request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
            {
                return await _context.Activities.ToListAsync(cancellationToken);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
- `Query`: Defines what the request returns (list of activities).
- `Handler`: Injects the database context, fetches data asynchronously, and passes the cancellation token (for handling request cancellations).

## Handler for Activity Details (GetActivityDetails.cs)

- Similar structure, but with an ID parameter.
```csharp
using MediatR;
using Domain;
using Persistence;

namespace Application.Activities.Queries
{
    public class GetActivityDetails
    {
        public class Query : IRequest<Activity>
        {
            public required string Id { get; set; } // Required ID parameter
        }

        public class Handler : IRequestHandler<Query, Activity>
        {
            private readonly AppDbContext _context;

            public Handler(AppDbContext context)
            {
                _context = context;
            }

            public async Task<Activity> Handle(Query request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
            {
                var activity = await _context.Activities.FindAsync([request.Id], cancellationToken);
                if (activity == null)
                {
                    throw new Exception("Activity not found"); // Temporary; improve later
                }
                return activity;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
- Note: Use `FindAsync` with array for keys; check for null and throw an exception (can't return HTTP responses here).

## Key Commands Recap
- Install package: `dotnet add package MediatR`
- Restart API: In terminal, confirm and restart if hot reload fails.

## Tips for Beginners
- Cancellation tokens: They allow graceful stops (e.g., if a user cancels a request)—pass them to async methods but don't worry deeply yet.
- Null handling: In handlers, throw exceptions for now; later sections cover better error strategies since handlers aren't API-aware.
- Test early: Use Postman to verify—send GET requests and update IDs to match real data.

# Section 3: Using Mediator in API Controllers

## Overview

### Definition
API controllers receive HTTP requests and use Mediator to delegate logic to handlers, keeping controllers "thin" (minimal code).

### Purpose
This shifts logic to the application layer, making controllers simple routers for requests and responses.

### Key Idea
Controllers send queries via `Mediator.Send(new Query())` and return the result directly.

> **Analogy**: Controllers are like waiters—they take your order (request), pass it to the kitchen (Mediator/handler), and bring back the food (response).

## Learning Goals
- Replace direct database queries in controllers with Mediator calls.
- Clean up controllers by removing unnecessary injections.

## Updating ActivitiesController.cs

- Inject Mediator (temporarily) and replace old code:
```csharp
using MediatR;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Application.Activities.Queries;

namespace API.Controllers
{
    public class ActivitiesController : BaseApiController
    {
        [HttpGet]
        public async Task<ActionResult<List<Activity>>> GetActivities()
        {
            return await Mediator.Send(new GetActivityList.Query());
        }

        [HttpGet("{id}")]
        public async Task<ActionResult<Activity>> GetActivity(string id)
        {
            return await Mediator.Send(new GetActivityDetails.Query { Id = id });
        }
    }
}
```
- Remove `AppDbContext` injection once handlers are in place—controllers no longer query the DB directly.

## Tips for Beginners
- Thin controllers: Aim for no business logic here—just forwarding requests.
- Troubleshooting: If Postman returns errors, check IDs and restart the API.

# Section 4: Thinning Controllers with BaseApiController

## Overview

### Definition
Use a base controller to centralize shared services like Mediator, avoiding repeated injections in child controllers.

### Purpose
Makes code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and ensures essential services are always available.

### Key Idea
Protect a Mediator property in the base class, lazy-load it from HTTP context, and throw if unavailable.

> **Analogy**: Base controller is like a family toolbox—kids (child controllers) inherit access without buying their own tools.

## Learning Goals
- Create protected properties for shared services.
- Handle null checks to prevent runtime errors.

## Updating BaseApiController.cs

```csharp
using MediatR;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace API.Controllers
{
    [ApiController]
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    public abstract class BaseApiController : ControllerBase
    {
        private IMediator? _mediator;

        protected IMediator Mediator => _mediator ??= HttpContext.RequestServices.GetService<IMediator>()
            ?? throw new InvalidOperationException("IMediator service is unavailable");
    }
}
```
- Private backing field (`_mediator`) with null-coalescing assignment.
- Protected property for access in derived classes.

## Using in ActivitiesController

- Remove Mediator injection; use `Mediator` from base.
- Test in Postman to confirm functionality.

## Tips for Beginners
- Protected vs. private: Protected allows child classes to use it; private hides it.
- Common pitfall: Trust but verify—hot reload often fails, so restart and test.
- Next: This sets up for CRUD operations like creating activities using commands.

Below are beginner-friendly notes in Markdown format based on the provided transcript for creating and editing activities in a .NET application using the MediatR pattern, Entity Framework, and AutoMapper. The notes are structured to align with the specified style guide, focusing on clarity, simplicity, and practical steps for beginners.

# Section: Creating and Editing Activities in .NET with MediatR

## Overview of Commands in MediatR

### Definition
Commands in MediatR are objects that represent an action to mutate (change) the application's state, such as creating or editing a resource in the database.

### Purpose
Commands encapsulate the logic for operations like creating or updating data, making it easier to manage and test business logic in a .NET application.

### Key Idea
Commands in MediatR use the `IRequest` interface to define an action and its handler, which processes the action and interacts with the database.

> **Analogy**: Think of a command as a recipe card. The card (command) lists the ingredients (data) and instructions (logic) for cooking a dish (performing an action like creating or editing).

## Learning Goals
- **Understand Commands**: Learn how to create and handle commands using MediatR to perform CRUD operations.
- **Implement Create Handler**: Create a handler to add a new activity to the database.
- **Implement Edit Handler**: Update an existing activity using a command and AutoMapper for efficient property mapping.
- **Set Up AutoMapper**: Configure AutoMapper to simplify mapping between objects.

## Creating an Activity

### Command Setup
- Create a folder named `Commands` in the `Application` project to organize command-related classes.
- Add a new class file named `CreateActivity.cs` in the `Commands` folder.
- Define a `Command` class that implements `IRequest<string>` to return the ID of the created activity.

```csharp
public class CreateActivity
{
    public class Command : IRequest<string>
    {
        public required Activity Activity { get; set; }
    }
}
```

- **Why return a string?**: Although commands typically don’t return values, returning the created activity’s ID is practical for the client to reference the new resource. The ID is generated server-side to ensure uniqueness.

### Handler Implementation
- Create a `Handler` class within `CreateActivity.cs` that implements `IRequestHandler<Command, string>`.
- Inject the `DbContext` to interact with the database.
- Add the activity to the context and save changes to the database.

```csharp
public class Handler : IRequestHandler<Command, string>
{
    private readonly DataContext _context;

    public Handler(DataContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public async Task<string> Handle(Command request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        _context.Activities.Add(request.Activity);
        await _context.SaveChangesAsync(cancellationToken);
        return request.Activity.Id;
    }
}
```

- **Why not use `AddAsync`?**: The `Add` method is sufficient because it only tracks the entity in memory for Entity Framework. `AddAsync` is needed only for specific database-generated value scenarios (e.g., SQL Server sequence generation).

### API Endpoint
- In the `ActivitiesController`, add an HTTP POST endpoint to handle activity creation.
- Use MediatR to send the `CreateActivity.Command` with the activity data.

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public async Task<ActionResult<string>> CreateActivity(Activity activity)
{
    return await _mediator.Send(new CreateActivity.Command { Activity = activity });
}
```

### Testing the Endpoint
- Use Postman to send a POST request to `/api/activities` with a JSON body containing activity details (e.g., title, description, date).
- **Example JSON**:
  ```json
  {
    "title": "Test Activity",
    "description": "This is a test activity",
    "date": "2025-11-06T00:00:00Z"
  }
  ```
- The server responds with the created activity’s ID and a 200 OK status.
- Verify the activity by sending a GET request to `/api/activities/{id}` to retrieve the newly created activity.

## Editing an Activity

### Command Setup
- Create a new class file named `EditActivity.cs` in the `Commands` folder.
- Define a `Command` class that implements `IRequest` (no return value since editing doesn’t need to return data).

```csharp
public class EditActivity
{
    public class Command : IRequest
    {
        public required Activity Activity { get; set; }
    }
}
```

### Handler Implementation
- Create a `Handler` class that implements `IRequestHandler<Command>`.
- Retrieve the activity from the database using its ID, update its properties, and save changes.

```csharp
public class Handler : IRequestHandler<Command>
{
    private readonly DataContext _context;

    public Handler(DataContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public async Task Handle(Command request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var activity = await _context.Activities.FindAsync([request.Activity.Id], cancellationToken)
            ?? throw new Exception("Cannot find activity");
        activity.Title = request.Activity.Title; // Manual mapping example
        await _context.SaveChangesAsync(cancellationToken);
    }
}
```

- **Note**: Manually mapping each property (e.g., `activity.Title = request.Activity.Title`) is tedious for objects with many properties. AutoMapper can simplify this.

### API Endpoint
- Add an HTTP PUT endpoint in `ActivitiesController` to handle editing.
- Return a 204 No Content status to indicate a successful update without returning data.

```csharp
[HttpPut]
public async Task<ActionResult> EditActivity(Activity activity)
{
    await _mediator.Send(new EditActivity.Command { Activity = activity });
    return NoContent();
}
```

### Testing the Endpoint
- Send a PUT request to `/api/activities` with the activity ID and updated fields in the JSON body.
- **Example JSON**:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "generated-id-from-create",
    "title": "Test Activity Updated",
    "description": "Updated description"
  }
  ```
- Expect a 204 No Content response.
- Verify the update by sending a GET request to `/api/activities/{id}` to confirm the title and other fields are updated.

## Using AutoMapper for Editing

### Why AutoMapper?
- Manually mapping properties between objects is repetitive and error-prone, especially for objects with many fields.
- AutoMapper automates mapping by matching properties with the same names between source and destination objects.

### Setup AutoMapper
- Install the `AutoMapper` NuGet package in the `Application` project:
  ```bash
  dotnet add package AutoMapper
  ```
- Create a `Core` folder in the `Application` project for shared utilities.
- Add a `MappingProfiles.cs` class that inherits from `Profile` to define mapping rules.

```csharp
public class MappingProfiles : Profile
{
    public MappingProfiles()
    {
        CreateMap<Activity, Activity>();
    }
}
```

- Register AutoMapper in the `Program.cs` file to make it available for dependency injection:
  ```csharp
  builder.Services.AddAutoMapper(typeof(MappingProfiles).Assembly);
  ```

### Update Edit Handler with AutoMapper
- Inject `IMapper` into the `EditActivity` handler.
- Use `mapper.Map` to map properties from the request’s activity to the database activity.

```csharp
public class Handler : IRequestHandler<Command>
{
    private readonly DataContext _context;
    private readonly IMapper _mapper;

    public Handler(DataContext context, IMapper mapper)
    {
        _context = context;
        _mapper = mapper;
    }

    public async Task Handle(Command request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var activity = await _context.Activities.FindAsync([request.Activity.Id], cancellationToken)
            ?? throw new Exception("Cannot find activity");
        _mapper.Map(request.Activity, activity);
        await _context.SaveChangesAsync(cancellationToken);
    }
}
```

### Testing AutoMapper
- Send a PUT request with multiple updated fields (e.g., title and description).
- Verify the response is 204 No Content and check the updated activity via a GET request to confirm all fields are updated correctly.

## Key Commands Recap
- **Create Activity**:
  - `dotnet add package MediatR`: Installs MediatR for command handling.
  - `_context.Activities.Add(request.Activity)`: Tracks the activity in Entity Framework.
  - `_context.SaveChangesAsync(cancellationToken)`: Saves changes to the database.
- **Edit Activity**:
  - `_context.Activities.FindAsync([request.Activity.Id], cancellationToken)`: Retrieves an activity by ID.
  - `mapper.Map(source, destination)`: Maps properties between objects using AutoMapper.
- **AutoMapper Setup**:
  - `dotnet add package AutoMapper`: Installs AutoMapper.
  - `builder.Services.AddAutoMapper(typeof(MappingProfiles).Assembly)`: Registers AutoMapper in the application.

## Tips for Beginners
- **Use `required` Keyword**: Mark properties like `Activity` as `required` to ensure they’re provided, but be aware that validation errors may be harder to handle on the client without additional setup.
- **Understand Async vs. Non-Async**: Use non-async methods like `Add` when only tracking entities in memory, and reserve async methods like `SaveChangesAsync` for database operations.
- **Check Hot Reload Limitations**: .NET Hot Reload often doesn’t work for significant changes (e.g., adding new classes or services). Restart the application after changes to ensure they take effect.
- **Test with Postman**: Use Postman to simulate API requests and verify responses. Remove unnecessary fields like `id` from POST requests if the server generates them.
- **Simplify with AutoMapper**: AutoMapper reduces boilerplate code for mapping properties, making your code cleaner and less error-prone.

# Section: Deleting Activities and Understanding Cancellation Tokens in .NET

## Overview of Delete Operations and Cancellation Tokens

### Definition
- **Delete Operation**: A command in MediatR to remove an activity from the database using its ID.
- **Cancellation Token**: A mechanism in .NET to signal that an operation (e.g., a database query) should be canceled, typically used for long-running tasks to improve resource efficiency.

### Purpose
- The delete operation allows users to remove activities from the database via an API endpoint.
- Cancellation tokens help stop unnecessary operations when a client request is aborted (e.g., a user closes their browser), saving server resources.

### Key Idea
- The delete operation uses a MediatR command to locate and remove an activity, while cancellation tokens enable graceful termination of operations when a client request is canceled.

> **Analogy**: A delete operation is like removing a book from a library shelf—you specify the book’s ID, and it’s taken off the shelf. A cancellation token is like a librarian stopping a search for a book if the borrower leaves the library before the search is complete.

## Learning Goals
- **Implement Delete Handler**: Create a MediatR handler to delete an activity from the database.
- **Understand Cancellation Tokens**: Learn the purpose of cancellation tokens and why they’re less critical for fast database queries.
- **Set Up Debugging in VSCode**: Configure the VSCode debugger to inspect code execution in a .NET API project.
- **Test CRUD Operations**: Verify the delete operation using Postman and understand the full CRUD lifecycle.

## Deleting an Activity

### Command Setup
- Create a new file named `DeleteActivity.cs` in the `Application/Commands` folder.
- Define a `Command` class that implements `IRequest` (no return value since deletion doesn’t return data).
- Include the activity’s ID as a required property.

```csharp
public class DeleteActivity
{
    public class Command : IRequest
    {
        public required string Id { get; set; }
    }
}
```

### Handler Implementation
- Create a `Handler` class that implements `IRequestHandler<Command>`.
- Inject the `DbContext` to interact with the database.
- Retrieve the activity by ID, remove it, and save changes.

```csharp
public class Handler : IRequestHandler<Command>
{
    private readonly DataContext _context;

    public Handler(DataContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public async Task Handle(Command request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var activity = await _context.Activities.FindAsync([request.Id], cancellationToken)
            ?? throw new Exception("Cannot find activity");
        _context.Remove(activity);
        await _context.SaveChangesAsync(cancellationToken);
    }
}
```

- **Why not use `RemoveAsync`?**: Similar to `Add`, the `Remove` method only marks the entity for deletion in memory. `SaveChangesAsync` handles the actual database operation, so async is only needed there.

### API Endpoint
- Add an HTTP DELETE endpoint in the `ActivitiesController` to handle deletion.
- Specify the route parameter `{id}` to pass the activity ID.
- Return a 200 OK status to indicate successful deletion.

```csharp
[HttpDelete("{id}")]
public async Task<ActionResult> DeleteActivity(string id)
{
    await _mediator.Send(new DeleteActivity.Command { Id = id });
    return Ok();
}
```

### Testing the Endpoint
- Use Postman to send a DELETE request to `/api/activities/{id}` with the ID of an existing activity.
- Expect a 200 OK response.
- Verify deletion by sending a GET request to `/api/activities/{id}`. It should fail with an exception (e.g., "Cannot find activity"), indicating the activity no longer exists.
- **Note**: Throwing exceptions for not-found scenarios isn’t ideal; better error handling will be addressed later.

## Understanding Cancellation Tokens

### What Are Cancellation Tokens?
- A `CancellationToken` is a .NET object passed to async methods to signal when an operation should stop.
- It’s useful for long-running operations (e.g., complex database queries) where a client might cancel a request (e.g., closing a browser).

### Why Use Them?
- They prevent unnecessary resource usage by stopping operations when a client aborts a request.
- In the provided example, cancellation tokens are passed to methods like `SaveChangesAsync` and `FindAsync` to allow cancellation if needed.

### Why Not Critical Here?
- The application’s database queries are fast, completing in milliseconds, so cancellation tokens have limited impact.
- They’re more relevant for operations taking seconds (e.g., 10–30 seconds) where a user might cancel a request.

### Demonstration with Fake Delay
- To illustrate cancellation tokens, add a fake delay to the `GetActivities` handler to simulate a long-running query.
- Inject `ILogger` for logging and use a `try-catch` block to handle cancellation.

```csharp
public class Handler : IRequestHandler<Query, List<Activity>>
{
    private readonly DataContext _context;
    private readonly ILogger<Handler> _logger;

    public Handler(DataContext context, ILogger<Handler> logger)
    {
        _context = context;
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public async Task<List<Activity>> Handle(Query request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        try
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            {
                cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
                await Task.Delay(1000, cancellationToken);
                _logger.LogInformation($"Task {i} has completed");
            }
        }
        catch
        {
            _logger.LogInformation("Task was canceled");
            throw;
        }
        return await _context.Activities.ToListAsync(cancellationToken);
    }
}
```

- Update the `ActivitiesController` to pass the cancellation token to the MediatR `Send` method:

```csharp
[HttpGet]
public async Task<ActionResult<List<Activity>>> GetActivities(CancellationToken ct)
{
    return await _mediator.Send(new GetActivities.Query(), ct);
}
```

### Testing Cancellation Tokens
- Send a GET request in Postman to `/api/activities`.
- The fake delay causes the request to log every second (up to 10 seconds).
- Click Postman’s cancel button during the request. If the cancellation token is properly propagated, the handler logs "Task was canceled" and stops early.
- **Observation**: Without passing the cancellation token in the controller, cancellation doesn’t work. Both the controller and handler must support it.

### Cleanup
- Remove the fake delay, logger, and cancellation token from the `GetActivities` handler since they’re not needed for fast queries.
- The example was for demonstration only, as the application’s queries are too quick for cancellation tokens to be practical.

## Setting Up the VSCode Debugger

### Why Use a Debugger?
- Debuggers allow you to pause code execution, inspect variables, and step through logic to identify issues.
- In VSCode, the debugger can attach to a running .NET process or launch the application for debugging.

### Configuration Steps
1. **Create `launch.json`**:
   - In VSCode, go to the Debug tab (Run and Debug).
   - Click “create a launch.json file” and select “C#” as the environment.
   - Add two configurations:
     - **.NET Core Attach**: Attaches to a running API process.
     - **.NET Core Launch**: Launches the API and attaches the debugger.

2. **Example `launch.json`**:
   ```json
   {
       "version": "0.2.0",
       "configurations": [
           {
               "name": ".NET Core Attach",
               "type": "coreclr",
               "request": "attach",
               "processId": "${command:pickProcess}"
           },
           {
               "name": "API Debug",
               "type": "coreclr",
               "request": "launch",
               "program": "${workspaceFolder}/API/bin/Debug/net8.0/API.dll",
               "args": [],
               "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/API",
               "stopAtEntry": false,
               "serverReadyAction": {
                   "action": "openExternally",
                   "pattern": "\\bNow listening on:\\s+(https?://\\S+)"
               },
               "preLaunchTask": "build",
               "projectPath": "${workspaceFolder}/API/API.csproj"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

3. **Set Breakpoints**:
   - Open a file (e.g., `ActivitiesController.cs` or `EditActivity.cs`).
   - Click in the gutter next to a line number to add a red breakpoint dot.

4. **Debug a Running Process**:
   - Ensure the API is running (`dotnet run` in the `API` folder).
   - In VSCode, select “.NET Core Attach” and choose the API process (e.g., `API` or `dotnet`).
   - Send a request in Postman (e.g., PUT to `/api/activities`). The debugger pauses at breakpoints, allowing inspection of variables like `activity` or `HttpContext`.

5. **Debug Startup Code**:
   - Stop the API server.
   - Add a breakpoint in `DbInitializer.cs` (e.g., in the `SeedData` method).
   - Select “API Debug” in VSCode and click Run. The debugger launches the API and pauses at the breakpoint.

### Testing the Debugger
- **Edit Activity Test**:
  - Set breakpoints in `ActivitiesController` (on `await _mediator.Send`) and `EditActivity.cs` (on `var activity = ...`).
  - Send a PUT request in Postman. The debugger pauses, showing the `activity` object’s properties (e.g., `Title`, `Id`).
  - Step through the code to observe AutoMapper updating the activity and saving changes.
- **Startup Test**:
  - Set a breakpoint in `DbInitializer.SeedData`.
  - Use “API Debug” to launch the application. The debugger pauses at the breakpoint, allowing inspection of startup logic.

## Section Summary: Clean Architecture and CRUD

### Key Concepts
- **Clean Architecture**: The solution is split into projects (e.g., `Application`, `Persistence`, `API`) to align with Uncle Bob’s 2012 recommendations for modular, testable code.
- **CQRS and MediatR**: Commands and queries separate read and write operations. MediatR handlers process business logic, and controllers return HTTP responses.
- **CRUD Operations**: The application now supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting activities via API endpoints.

### Frequently Asked Questions
- **Can Event Sourcing Be Used?**: Event sourcing is complex and out of scope for this course. See Greg Young’s YouTube talk for more details.
- **Can NoSQL Databases Be Used?**: Entity Framework doesn’t support NoSQL databases like MongoDB, but you can use MongoDB’s API with a repository pattern in the `Persistence` layer to replace Entity Framework queries.

## Key Commands Recap
- **Delete Activity**:
  - `_context.Remove(activity)`: Marks an activity for deletion in Entity Framework.
  - `_context.SaveChangesAsync(cancellationToken)`: Saves changes to the database.
- **Debugger Setup**:
  - `dotnet run`: Starts the API server for attaching the debugger.
  - Create `launch.json` in VSCode to configure debugging options.
- **Testing**:
  - Use Postman to send DELETE requests and verify with GET requests.
  - Use VSCode’s Debug tab to attach or launch the debugger.

## Tips for Beginners
- **Validate Delete Requests**: Currently, a missing activity throws an exception. Consider returning a 404 Not Found response for better client experience (to be improved later).
- **Use Cancellation Tokens Sparingly**: Only use cancellation tokens for long-running operations. For quick queries, they add unnecessary complexity.
- **Restart After Changes**: .NET Hot Reload often fails for significant changes (e.g., new files or services). Always restart the API with `dotnet run` to ensure changes apply.
- **Experiment with Debugging**: Use breakpoints to inspect variables like `activity` or `HttpContext`. Step through code to understand the flow of MediatR and Entity Framework.
- **Commit Changes**: Stage and commit code changes to source control (e.g., Git) after completing a section to track progress.
