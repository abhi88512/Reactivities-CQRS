# Section 1: Creating the React Project with Vite

## Introduction to Vite

### Definition
Vite is a modern build tool for web development that helps create and manage front-end projects quickly. It's like a helper that sets up your project structure, compiles your code, and runs a local server for testing

> **Analogy**: Think of Vite as a fast-food drive-thru for web projects—it gets you a ready-to-go React app in seconds, without needing to cook everything from scratch.


## Creating the Project

### Steps to Create
- Visit the Vite website (vite.dev) for documentation if needed.
- Open your terminal in VS Code at the solution folder level (where your .NET project is).
- Run the command to create the project:
  ```bash
  npm create vite@latest
  ```
- Follow the prompts:
  - Confirm installation of packages: Yes.
  - Project name: "client" (or any simple name for your front-end code).
  - Framework: React.
  - Variant: TypeScript + SWC (Speedy Web Compiler for faster performance).

### Post-Creation Steps
- Navigate into the project folder:
  ```bash
  cd client
  ```
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- Start the development server:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
- Open your browser to the provided URL (e.g., http://localhost:5173) to see the default React page with a counter button.

## Key Commands Recap
- `npm create vite@latest`: Creates a new Vite-based project.
- `npm install`: Installs required packages.
- `npm run dev`: Starts the local server for development.

## Project Structure Overview

### Definition
The React project created by Vite includes essential files like configuration, dependencies, and starter code. It's a single-page application (SPA), meaning it loads one HTML file and updates dynamically without full page reloads.

### Purpose
Exploring the files helps you understand how React works under the hood, allowing you to customize and simplify the app for your needs, like building a front-end for a .NET API.

### Key Idea
Key files like `vite.config.ts`, `package.json`, `index.html`, `main.tsx`, and `App.tsx` form the foundation—modify them to tailor your app.

> **Analogy**: Your React project is like a new house from a builder; it comes with basic furniture (default files), but you rearrange or remove things to make it your own.

## Learning Goals
- Identify and edit core files in a React project.
- Update dependencies and configurations for better performance.
- Simplify starter code to focus on your app's logic.

## Configuring the Project

### Changing the Port
- Open `vite.config.ts` in the project root.
- Add a server configuration to set a custom port (e.g., 3000, the traditional React port):
  ```typescript
  import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
  import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react-swc'

  export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [react()],
    server: {
      port: 3000
    }
  })
  ```
- Save the file—the server restarts automatically, and your app now runs on http://localhost:3000.

### Updating React Version
- Open `package.json`.
- Change React and React-DOM dependencies to the latest stable version (e.g., from 18.3.1 to 19.0.0 or whatever the latest is—hover over the package name in VS Code for suggestions).
- Run `npm install` in the "client" folder to apply changes.
- Refresh your browser; the app should still work without issues.

## Key Files and Their Roles

### index.html
- The main entry point for the browser.
- Contains a `<div id="root"></div>` where React loads the app.
- Loads `main.tsx` via a script tag.
- Tip: Change the `<title>` to something like "Reactivities" for your app.

### main.tsx
- Gets the root element from HTML and renders the React app.
- Uses `createRoot` to start the app in strict mode (helps catch errors early).
- Renders the `<App />` component.
- Code example (simplified):
  ```tsx
  import { StrictMode } from 'react'
  import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
  import App from './App.tsx'

  createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
    <StrictMode>
      <App />
    </StrictMode>,
  )
  ```

### App.tsx
- The main React component—a function returning JSX (JavaScript XML, which looks like HTML but is JavaScript).
- Simplify by removing extras:
  - Delete imports for CSS and logos.
  - Replace content with basic JSX:
    ```tsx
    function App() {
      return (
        <h3>Reactivities</h3>
      )
    }

    export default App
    ```
- Note: Use `className` instead of `class` for styling classes, as `class` is a JavaScript keyword.

## React Component

### Definition
A React component is a simple JavaScript function that returns JSX, which stands for JavaScript XML—a way to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.

### Purpose
Components help build reusable UI pieces. In this course, they're used to fetch and display data from an API in the browser.

### Key Idea
JSX looks like HTML but follows JavaScript rules, so some attributes (like "class") are renamed to avoid conflicts.

> **Analogy**: Think of JSX as HTML dressed in JavaScript clothes— it mimics HTML but must play by JavaScript's rules, like using "className" instead of "class" because "class" is already taken in JS.


## Technical Concept
### JSX Syntax Differences
- Use `className` instead of `class` for CSS classes (e.g., `<div className="app">`).
- Inline styles are objects in double curly braces: `style={{ color: 'red' }}`.
- Embed JavaScript variables in JSX with curly braces: `{variableName}`.

```jsx
// Example in App.tsx
const title = "Welcome to React Activities";
return (
  <div>
    <h1 style={{ color: 'red' }}>{title}</h1>
  </div>
);
```

## React Hooks

### Definition
Hooks are special functions in React that let you "hook into" features like state management (useState) or side effects (useEffect).

### Purpose
useState stores data (like API results) that the component "remembers" across renders. useEffect runs code (like fetching data) when the component loads.

### Key Idea
Hooks add memory and lifecycle behavior to functional components, enabling data fetching and display.

> **Analogy**: useState is like a notebook where the component jots down data to remember; useEffect is a "on-load" alarm that triggers actions like fetching data.

## Technical Concept
### Setting Up useState
- Initialize with an empty array: `const [activities, setActivities] = useState([]);`.

### Using useEffect for Fetching
- Runs on mount with an empty dependency array `[]`.
- Fetch data from API and update state.

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [activities, setActivities] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://localhost:5001/api/activities')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setActivities(data));
  }, []); // Empty array: runs once on mount

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Activities</h3>
      <ul>
        {activities.map(activity => (
          <li key={activity.id}>{activity.title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Key Commands Recap
- `fetch(url)`: Native JS to request data from an API.

## Tips for Beginners
- Always add a `key` prop (unique like `activity.id`) to list items in loops to help React track changes efficiently.
- Arrow functions (`() => {}`) are shorthand for callbacks—great for concise code in hooks.

## CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

### Definition
CORS is a browser security feature that blocks requests between different domains (e.g., localhost:3000 to localhost:5001) unless the server allows it.

### Purpose
It prevents unauthorized access but needs setup on the server to enable API calls from the React app.

### Key Idea
Add CORS middleware in the .NET API to permit requests from specific origins.

> **Analogy**: CORS is like a bouncer at a club— the API server decides which "websites" (origins) get in by adding permission headers.

## Learning Goals
- Identify CORS errors in browser dev tools (Console/Network tabs).
- Configure CORS in .NET Program.cs.

## Technical Concept
### Adding CORS in .NET API
- In `Program.cs`, add the service and middleware.

```csharp
// In Program.cs
builder.Services.AddCors(); // Add service

// Middleware (order matters: before MapControllers)
app.UseCors(x => x
  .AllowAnyHeader()
  .AllowAnyMethod()
  .WithOrigins("http://localhost:3000", "https://localhost:3000"));
```

## Key Commands Recap
- `dotnet run`: Restart API after changes (or Ctrl+R in terminal).

## Tips for Beginners
- Check Network tab in dev tools—if status is 200 but blocked, it's CORS. Refresh after server restart.
- Add both http and https origins early to avoid future updates.

## Strict Mode in React

### Definition
Strict Mode is a React feature in development that runs extra checks, like executing useEffect twice to test cleanup logic.

### Purpose
It helps catch bugs early, but can cause duplicate API calls during development (not in production).

### Key Idea
Double fetches are intentional in dev mode for testing—no harm, as state overwrites previous data.

> **Analogy**: Strict Mode is like a driving instructor making you practice maneuvers twice—it ensures your code handles real-world scenarios reliably.

## Learning Goals
- Recognize why duplicate requests happen in dev tools.
- Know it's not a bug and doesn't affect production.

## Technical Concept
### Observing in Dev Tools
- In Main.tsx: `<React.StrictMode><App /></React.StrictMode>`.
- Causes useEffect to run, "clean up" (even if empty), then run again.

## Tips for Beginners
- Ignore double fetches for now—they're harmless and vanish in production builds.
- Focus on state updates: `setActivities` overwrites, so no duplicate data shows.

## TypeScript Basics

### Definition
TypeScript is JavaScript with types— it checks code for errors before runtime, like unknown properties.

### Purpose
Prevents typos and provides better autocompletion (IntelliSense) when working with data like API responses.

### Key Idea
Define types at the top level; let TypeScript infer the rest to catch errors early.

> **Analogy**: TypeScript is like a spell-checker for code—it yells if you misspell a property, saving you from runtime surprises.

## Learning Goals
- Create and use custom types for data.
- Fix "any" or "never" type warnings.

## Technical Concept
### Creating Types from JSON
- Use tools like json2ts.com to generate types from API responses.
- Store in `src/lib/types/index.ts`.

```typescript
// In src/lib/types/index.ts
type Activity = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  // Add other properties like date, description, etc.
};
```

### Applying Types in Code
- Specify in useState: `useState<Activity[]>([])`.

```jsx
const [activities, setActivities] = useState<Activity[]>([]);
```

## Key Commands Recap
- Alt+Shift+F (or right-click > Format Document): Auto-format code in VSCode.

## Tips for Beginners
- Copy JSON from API (Network tab) and convert to types to avoid manual typos.
- Don't over-type: Specify once (e.g., in useState), and inference handles the rest—like not needing `activity: Activity` in maps.

## HTTPS in Development

### Definition
HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that encrypts data between the browser and server, using certificates to verify trust.

### Purpose
Running the React app over HTTPS in development mimics production environments (where HTTPS is required for security), helping catch issues early without affecting functionality over plain HTTP.

### Key Idea
Use a Vite plugin to generate a locally trusted certificate, making development closer to real-world deployment.

> **Analogy**: Think of HTTPS as locking your front door—it's not always needed at home (development), but practicing it ensures you're ready for the outside world (production).

## Learning Goals
- Understand why aligning dev and production environments matters.
- Install and configure a plugin for local HTTPS support.

## Technical Concept
### Installing vite-plugin-mkcert
- Open a terminal in the client project.
- Run the install command; it adds to dev dependencies.
- The plugin creates a local certificate authority (CA) that your machine trusts for dev purposes only—not for the internet.

```bash
# Install the plugin
npm install -D vite-plugin-mkcert
```

### Configuring Vite
- In `vite.config.ts`, import and add the plugin.

```typescript
// In vite.config.ts
import mkcert from 'vite-plugin-mkcert';

// Add to plugins array
plugins: [react(), mkcert()],
```

- Restart the dev server: `npm run dev`.
- It may prompt for admin permissions to install the local CA.
- The app now runs on `https://localhost:3000` (or similar).

## Key Commands Recap
- `npm install -D vite-plugin-mkcert`: Adds the HTTPS plugin.
- `npm run dev`: Starts the server, potentially with sudo prompts for certificate setup.

## Tips for Beginners
- If on a work machine or with strict security, skip this—HTTP works fine for learning.
- Check browser dev tools for certificate details; it should show as secure but note it's dev-only.
- Don't worry if prompts appear; they're for trusting the local cert—enter your password carefully.

## Axios Library

### Definition
Axios is a popular JavaScript library for making HTTP requests, built on promises, with extras like automatic JSON handling.

### Purpose
Replaces native `fetch` for simpler, more feature-rich API calls, including TypeScript support and request interception (useful later).

### Key Idea
Axios streamlines data fetching by handling JSON automatically and allowing type specifications for better code reliability.

> **Analogy**: If `fetch` is a basic bicycle for getting data, Axios is a geared bike—easier to ride, with tools for hills (like intercepting requests).

## Learning Goals
- Install and integrate Axios in a React app.
- Update fetch code to use Axios for API GET requests.

## Technical Concept
### Installing Axios
- In the terminal: Install as a dependency.

```bash
npm install axios
```

### Replacing Fetch with Axios
- Import Axios in `App.tsx`.
- Use `axios.get` with type parameter for the response.
- It auto-parses JSON, so simplify the promise chain.

```typescript
// In App.tsx
import axios from 'axios';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Activity } from './lib/types'; // Assuming your type file

const [activities, setActivities] = useState<Activity[]>([]);

useEffect(() => {
  axios.get<Activity[]>('https://localhost:5001/api/activities')
    .then(response => setActivities(response.data));
}, []);
```

- Refresh the app; it fetches data like before, but with Axios benefits.
- Note: Strict mode still causes double requests—harmless and will be handled later.

## Key Commands Recap
- `npm install axios`: Adds the library.
- `axios.get<Activity[]>(url)`: Fetches typed data.
